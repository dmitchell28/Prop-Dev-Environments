    "\n",
    "### 1. Setup Environment\n",
    "First, import all the necessary libraries and create the BQL service object by calling `bq = bql.Service()`. While it's not required to import libraries at the top of the document, doing so will prevent you from trying to use a library before it's imported. Most Python developers import libraries at the top, so developing this habit will also make your code easier for others to understand. Avoid importing libraries you won't use. If you discover you need to import an additional library, simply add it to the first cell. Re-run this first cell if you add new libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Get Data from Bloomberg using BQL\n",
    "Once you have all the libraries your project needs, use BQL to fetch data from Bloomberg. This data will feed your analysis and populate any visualizations you create.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Additional Data Munging (if necessary)\n",
    "Step 3 is not always necessary. It may be that the results of your BQL request are all that's needed to continue development. Occasionally, however, you may need to manipulate the DataFrame returned by BQL to reformat it before visualization or perform some additional analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. User Interface & Visualizations\n",
    "A User Interface (UI) is what the end-user of your app will see. For some projects, the UI is just the Jupyter Notebook itself. For others, you may want the user to see a graphical display with charts, buttons, or other widgets while hiding the underlying code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Simplify, Document, & Publish\n",
    "Refactor any unnecessarily complex code. Finalize your project with code comments and Markdown cells to help others understand your project. Publish your app to your Terminal Launchpad or share with others at your firm."
